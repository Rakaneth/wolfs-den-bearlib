# Wolf's Den, Lua + BearLibTerminal Edition

This is yet another port of my Wolf's Den roguelike concept used to learn and experiment. 
This port uses Lua and BearLibTerminal. This gets updated/worked on based on interest and available time.
Feel free to fork/use as you wish. 


# How to Run

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/Rakaneth/wolfs-den-bearlib` 
2. Ensure that you have (Lua 5.3.5)[https://www.lua.org] installed.
3. Run `lua main.lua` from a command prompt.

The Windows 32-bit BearLibTerminal.dll is included. This should work with Linux also with the BearLibTerminal Linux library, 
which can be found (here)[http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal]

# DONE

* Hello, Terminal!
